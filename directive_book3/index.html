	This example shows how isolate scope binding works.
	<ul>
	<li> Use @ when you want to pass one way <b>string</b></li>
	<li> Use = when you want to have two way variable</li>
	<li> Use & when you want to pass ctrl function to be invoked</li>
	<p>
	Note: With @ you are passing string. Whatever you specified in directive as attribute</br>
	that will be converted into a string and passed to the directive. (see textVar)</br>
	Directive can use it as own variable. If it is udated in Ctr change will be propagated to the directive</br>
	However, if you change it in the directive, it will not be propagated to the Ctr. (see ChangeDirVars button)</br>
	With = you are telling directive to use <b>attribute's value</b> to find out property on ctrl scope</br>
	that binds to this directive scope variable. (see myTwoWay). Here directive attribute value is: twoWayVar</br>
	So, whenever you refer to rwVar, you are actually referring to Ctrl: $scope.twoWayVar </br>
	With &, you are telling directive to use <b>attribute value</b> as ctrl function to be invoked every time</br>
	this local function gets invoked. (see action) 
	</p>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<div ng-controller="myCtrl" ng-init="title='Hello world'">
		<p>----- Parent (Ctrl) scope ----</p>
		Ctrl text = <b>{{textVar}}</b></br>
		TwoWay binding = <b>{{twoWayVar}}</b></br>
		<button id="newApp" ng-click="setCtrlVariables()">Ctrl Scope!</button>
		<p>----- Directive scope ----</p>
		<my-scoped-directive
			my-text="{{textVar}}"
			my-action="changeData()"
			my-two-way="twoWayVar">
		</my-scoped-directive>
